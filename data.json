Sometimes adults may be seen eating fungi or rotten fruit in addition to maggots and other insect larvae that also feed on a decaying animals. Dried skin and muscle tissue is eaten as well.  This unsavory role aids in returning nutrients from dead animals back into the ecological food web. \n\nThis little beetle has the appearance of a bumble bee at first glance, especially in flight. It can smell carrion and flies to it, landing on it and quickly going to work. The yellowish pronotum ('shoulder' area) has a distinct black spot or mark on it.\n\nAdults prefer moist habitats and are active all summer and more so on warm days. They can be found in moist areas.  Hiding is its preferred method of defense. Eggs are laid near a decaying animal in order to keep the newly hatched black larvae close to a food source.  It takes about 3 months for larvae to mature into adulthood. One generation of beetles is born each year.","sizerange":[13,22],"colors":["black","tan","ivory","yellow"],"keywords":["spot","rough","mark","flying"],"reach":["Alabama","Arizona","Arkansas","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan"],"category":"Beetle","common_name":"American Carrion Beetle","scientific_name":"Necrophila americana"},{"name":"Achemon Sphinx Moth","about":"Achemon Sphinx Moths are members of the hawkmoth family.

They span most of the North American continent and are on the wing throughout the summer.\n\nThe larval caterpillar is also brown, like the adult. They are larger than other families of caterpillars.  Seven short white lines run diagonally down the side of the hairless body from the head to its other end.  It is a part of the hornworm group of caterpillars thanks to a long spine, or \"horn\" at the end of its body.  As the caterpillar grows and matures, the horn is eventually lost and an eyespot develops instead. This species feeds on the leaves of grapevines and is known to be a pest in vineyards.

If a bee is having a good day, you will be able to see the full baskets, holding their orange/yellow pollen.  \n\nBumble bees are industrious pollinators.  They forage for pollen all over meadows, parks, open fields, gardens and forests. They use the pollen to make honey, which sustains them in colder months.  They also drink flower nectar. \n\nThey are beneficial insects, helping to pollinate crops, orchards and garden plants.  Sadly, its numbers are declining for a variety of reasons.  Habitat loss, pesticide use, pollution and mites are reducing the number of bee colonies in the U.S..  Without these small workers, most plants would need to be pollinated by hand.

This snout is a hollow tube and is used, like a drinking straw, to suck juices out of plant matter. Adults pierce the soft tissue of a young acorn, the seed of oak trees, while they are growing.  They drink from the acorn and create a puncture that is wide and deep enough to house an egg.  Females will lay a fertilized egg inside this hole and plug it up with a pile of their own feces.  \n\nAfter some time the acorn hardens and turns brown, ready for germination.  It will fall off the branch onto the ground below.  Soon after, a newly hatched weevil larva (grub) will squeeze itself through the small hole created by its parent, slowly forcing its chubby body out of the acorn nut.  Once free, the grub will start burrowing into the dirt to remain hidden from predators while it develops into an adult.  \n\nAcorn Weevils can damage an acorn crop if a tree is infested.  This would result in fewer new oak trees in that area.  The larvae are a protein-packed food source for many other insects, as well as spiders and small animals. Adult Acorn Weevils are hunted by a variety of Weevil Wasps and will eventually become live meals for hatching wasp larvae.","sizerange":[4,10],"colors":["brown","black"],"keywords":["snout","trunk","nose","hairy","fuzzy","flying"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","British Columbia","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan","Mexico"],"category":"Beetle","common_name":"Acorn Weevil","scientific_name":"Conotrachelus posticatus","other_names":"Nut Weevil"},{"name":"Ailanthus Webworm Moth","about":"The definitive coloring and stripes on this moth make it unique among Webworm Moths.

Unlike honeybees, their stingers are not barbed and stay attached to their abdomen despite repetitive use. Yellow Jacket venom is more potent than honey bee venom and stings are painful. Though avoidance is not always possible, do not swing at a Yellow Jacket as they can be easily provoked to attack and defend themselves or their nearby nest.\n\nAn Eastern (V. maculifrons) and Western (V. pennsylvanica) species of Yellow Jacket exist but there are few variations between them beyond color pattern.","sizerange":[12,16],"colors":["yellow","black","white"],"keywords":["stinging","flying"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","British Columbia","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan","Mexico"],"category":"Bee, Ant, Wasp and Similar","common_name":"Yellow Jacket","scientific_name":"Vespula spp."},{"name":"Yellow Sac Spider","about":"This albino-looking spider is commonly found in homes, high up on walls or crawling on ceilings.

Their natural habitat is outdoors in grass, shrubs and other vegetation.  Research shows that their body colors slightly reflect the color of the insect most recently consumed.  This is why differences in hue (rosy, greenish, etc) can be seen within the species.\n\nThis species is slightly more aggressive than most house spiders and will bite, perhaps repeatedly, if threatened.  Most contact with yellow sac spiders is accidental for its part.  They tend to hide in piles of clothes (clean or dirty) and bite if they feel pressure when the clothes are picked up and/or put on. \n\nThere is no consensus on how toxic the bite of this spider may be, although it is not known to be deadly.  The initial bite can be painful to some people, but unnoticed by others.  For some, a small red bump will form and eventually fade after a couple of weeks.  In others, swelling, burning and pain are experienced the first hour or so after the bite, then a pustule develops that naturally heals over a couple of weeks.  If bitten, it is suggested that the spider is caught (not smashed) so it can be identified if the bite develops into a serious skin infection.

These small invasions have made them a nuisance to homeowners. Groups of Western Conifer Seed Bugs can enter a house, office building or warehouse in the autumn through torn window screens, open doors and chimneys. Though they aren't known to  bite, their presence causes uneasiness to many people.\n\nThe primary diet of this species is the soft seed of pine trees, Douglas firs and other cone-bearing trees (hence 'conifer' in their name). They also eat the buds of cones and new needles. They pierce the tender plant parts and suck them dry.  This had led to a diminished seed supply in forests, meaning fewer conifer trees are sown that season and new tree growth decreases in that area. This is another reason why the Western Conifer Seed Bug is considered a pest. Many of the conifer trees they eat from are also used by people for lumber and Christmas trees.\n\nA type of Leaf-Footed Bug, Western Conifer Seed Bugs have long bodies and wide, flattened 'thighs'.  This species has small spikes on the upper hind legs and a light, white marking across the elytra (wing covering). They are flying insects and are known to buzz while in flight, which can make them easier to find.  The bright yellow and black contrasting bands along the sides of the abdomen are highly visible in flight and may lead an observer to first think it is a bee.

The glue that binds old book pages together is also appetizing to Silverfish.  This explains why they might also be found in the pages of old books, or running around libraries: the printing material used in these items is a food source. Amazingly, Silverfish can live for months without eating. They are harmless to humans, though their presence is usually considered a nuisance.\n\nSilverfish bodies are covered with flexible and slippery scales that protect the insect from capture from larger insects such as spiders. This body covering also allows them to neatly fit within the binding edge of a closed book and feed on the paste. \n\nAnother interesting facet about these critters is in the time that they take to mature. Southern Silverfish can see adulthood in 24 months whereas Northern-based Silverfish will take longer.

At most, the Ring-Legged Earwig lightly damages any plants that it may feast on but beyond that, a passerby is safe from those intimidating pincers.\n\nThese Earwigs generally appear as a brown or a black with some possible yellow on the body. The body itself can range between 10mm and 26mm in length and, though some species of Earwigs have wings, they seldom fly.\n\nRing-Legged Earwigs are very common in the outdoors, usually found around gardens and fields.

A parasitoid like the Repetitive Tachinid Fly helps keep caterpillar numbers in check, sparing food producing plants.\n\nFemale flies lay a fertilized egg either directly on, or in front of, a hungry moth caterpillar.  The egg will hatch and the fly larva (maggot) proceeds to eat the caterpillar to death, from the inside. This makes the fly larva a parasitoid, not a parasite that usually moves on to another host before killing its current host. \n\nAdult flies drink flower nectar, especially from asters and their relatives.

Stepping on one results in many ants crawling up the shoe and leg that can potentially bite.  They are not poisonous, but their bites can pinch.  Their presence is enough to cause people to walk around them and not through them.\n\nScouts for a colony will constantly search for food and other resources.  Red Pavement Ants often quickly find dropped food items and, in little time, completely cover the food item with their bodies. \n\nThough ants are typically associated with a fondness for sweets, they will consume any food.  Because of this, they can become house pests.  If a few scouts find food resources inside a building or home, they will infest the area.  There small size and great number make it difficult to control and infestations are best treated by a professional exterminator.  Preventative measures, such as sealing cracks in the foundation and removing wood debris from the sides of homes or buildings, may help avoid infiltration. Keeping food contained reduces the likelihood that scouts will find anything worth returning for. \n\nThe Red Pavement Ant is a member of the Formicidae family.  Large colonies are built with at least one queen ant laying eggs for a living.  This allows for rapid reproduction. Some males and females are winged (called 'alates') and mate in flight.  Both genders then lose their wings; males die and females land and begin a new colony.  Eggs are laid and cared for and kept underground until they hatch.","sizerange":[3,7],"colors":["red","brown"],"keywords":["infestation","sidewalk","biting","stinging","harmful"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming"],"category":"Bee, Ant, Wasp and Similar","common_name":"Red Pavement Ant","scientific_name":"Tetramorium caespitum"},{"name":"Red Oak Borer","about":"The larvae of this beetle bore into weak, but still living, Red Oak and White Oak wood.

This is a measure of safety for the eggs, helping ensure they hatch and are not eaten by birds or other insects patrolling the tree for dinner. In addition to the syringe-like ovipositor on females, both genders have an pointy, hard spine at the tip of their abdomen that resembles a spear tip. This gives females the appearance of having two 'stingers'.\n\nThey are commonly seen in hardwood forests and are a familiar sight to lumberjacks. The female dies immediately after laying her last egg, leaving her ovipositor stuck in the tree and becoming a potential meal herself. \n\nThere is only one Tremex species in North America. The larvae are actually victims of parasitism despite the measures the female takes to safeguard them.  Female Ichneumon Wasps lay their own eggs in the bark also using an ovipositor of their own.

Cicadas during this time can appear in the hundreds, if not thousands, as mating season commences. These collections - called 'broods' - leave behind many molted, brown, crunchy body exoskeleton shells on window screens, fence posts, tree trunks, plant stems and anywhere else they can stand. The long periods of high-pitched screeching calls are produced by the males in search of female partners. Different species of Cicada produce their own distinct sound.  Their life spans as adults is somewhat short, so reproduction is the focus of all their energy once they mature into adults.\n\nPeriodical Cicadas are large, chunky insects with bulging eyes on the sides of their heads. They are slow fliers and easy to catch by birds and other flying insects (i.e. wasps).  Their abundance in the years their population explodes means an easy feast for their predators.  They have no real defense against predators except large numbers - the neighboring cicada may be more appetizing.  \n\nThough Cicadas are generally found in forested areas and grasslands, the species can become a common sight (and sound) in neighborhoods during the summer. Folks from the Mississippi River basin to the eastern United States and Canada are pretty familiar with the Periodical Cicada.  While they are completely harmless, large numbers of them can become a nuisance to some people, covering cars and driveways, making it 'uncomfortable' to walk outside or drive on the unwitting insects (brings to mind the buggy cave scene in \"Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom\").\n\nFemales will insert eggs into a tree branch or bark and the hatched nymphs eventually make their way down the tree into the ground.  They burrow down by the tree's root system. Total maturity time of the nymph is about 13 to 17 years (hence 'periodical'). They eventually resurface after almost 2 decades underground and begin molting its early exoskeleton.

They are likely to build nests near humans as that is where a lot of wood can be found (homes, barns, sheds, fences, firewood, landscaping, etc.).  The wasps use wood to help create their nest.  \n\nThe primary queen is first to aggressively defend her nest and her oldest workers will join her in that effort.  People and animals that disturb nests may be stung multiple times as wasps do not die after one sting (like honeybees do). Aside from possibly suffering from painful stings, Northern Paper Wasps actually do a great job of removing plant-devouring caterpillars from gardens.  The adults eat them and will also use them to feed to their larvae when they hatch. They are so effective at this pest control that they are welcome sights in organic gardens since their presence negates the need for chemical pesticides. \n\nThis particular species of paper wasp contains multiple fertile females for a short time, though one queen dominates all of them. She hatches just before winter and quickly mates with males before hibernating.  In the spring, she establishes her nest by laying her eggs. Most of these are workers that are sterile. Fertile females and males are usually born in late summer and mate before they overwinter and establish their own nests the next spring. Once these fertile females hatch, though, they quickly come to understand their position in the social ranking. The primary queen eats any eggs that are not her own.  She tells them apart by using a chemical to 'tag' her own eggs and she avoids them. This way, she quashes any attempts to usurp her authority while she's still living. She, her workers and any males do not survive past autumn.\n\nA study was done to see what role facial recognition plays in the socialization of this species.  Northern Paper Wasps can tell the difference between their own species and other wasps in the same genus (cousins).  They become physically aggressive toward them and attack them to protect their nest.

A Caddisfly has a life cycle more similar to dragonflies.  Female Caddisflies lay their fertilized eggs either directly in water, or just above the water line on some kind of vegetation.  Creeks, streams, lagoons, ponds and lakes make great habitats.  Eggs hatch and the worm-like larvae live underwater for sometimes as long as a year.  They have feathery gills that allow them to breathe.  They build little cases or 'homes' for themselves that they bring with them everywhere they go and eventually use them when it is time to pupate. In the meantime, they feed on plant material under water or other small aquatic insects.  They molt multiple times underwater, growing larger, and building newer, bigger cases when needed.  After pupating into their winged adult form, they crawl or float out of the water and fly away. Adults have short life spans (just a month or so), making it a special thing to see one alive.  They do not eat.  Instead they spend all their remaining days reproducing.\n\nBecause much of the young Northern Caddisfly's life is spent underwater, the cleanliness of the water greatly impacts the insect's ability to survive.  Toxic or chemically polluted water kills the delicate larvae, which results in a small population or the complete absence of Caddisflies in that region.

A female larvae is fed a special diet by the workers, which makes her a fertile queen. Other female larvae are given a regular diet that renders them infertile. \n\nWorker bees are sterile females that measure between 9 and 18mm while a queen bee can be 18 to 20mm in length. Male drones lack stingers and are kept until reproduction is complete. They are then killed and removed from the hive.\n\nWorking bees feature a nearly all-black head with a body coloring of golden brown and black with patches of a dull orange. Yellow bands are easily distinguishable on the abdomen and wings are clear. Their entire bodies are covered in tiny hairs with these being most notable on the head an body. \n\nThey are found throughout the United States and are also bred commercially. Currently, honey bee populations are disappearing from commercial hives for unknown reasons.  Entomologists call this anomaly CCD, or Colony Collapse Disorder.  Honey bees are a super-pollinator for most fruits and vegetables grown for human consumption and a limited number of them can directly effect how much produce is harvested.\n\nThey originally came to the New World from Europe when early colonists came to settle in America.

Thousands are raised every year for deliberate release inside greenhouses, orchards, farms and gardens.\n\nThe larval Green Lacewing doesn't look like an insect at first glance.  It resembles a dirty cotton ball or pile of plant and dead insect debris.  This coat of camouflage is collected early after hatching in order to conceal itself from predators like ants.  Green Lacewing larvae have huge appetites. They hatch and are immediately hungry.  For this reason, females lay the tiny white eggs some distance apart so the siblings don't rush to eat each other as they hatch.\n\nLarvae eat any small insect they encounter, and aphids (smaller flying insect that are the bane of gardeners and growers) are on top of the list. For this reason, they are also called \"aphid lions\".  Aphids drink the juices of young plants, often killing them.  Infestations are difficult to eliminate due to their rapid reproduction rate.  Ants herd aphids like sheep in order to collect the sweet 'honeydew' they secrete from their bottoms.  Because Green Lacewing larvae eat aphids, ants are quick to kill them to protect the herd, hence the need for camouflage. Unchecked by ants, Green Lacewings can control aphid populations without the need for chemical pesticides.\n\nAdult Green Lacewings also eat aphids as well as pollen and the 'honeydew' created by aphids.

The Green Stink Bug's diet usually results in deformed or hardened produce that is not edible or usable for re-seeding.  Evidence of a Green Stink Bug's presence is seen on the host plant in the form of scarring, dimples, spotting on fruit and overall discoloration. Typically, the population levels of Green Stink Bugs is kept in check because they are eaten by a variety of other things: birds, spiders, toads, wasps and other bug-eating insects. Gardeners and farmers can also pick them off plants and kill them, though this can be time-consuming. Chemical control are used in heavily infested farms or gardens.\n\nGreen Stink Bugs look vastly different when they are young. Green eggs are laid in clusters and look like small seeds. Once the group of eggs hatch, round larvae emerge and may be mistaken for beetles. Nymphs (juveniles) are mostly black with fine white lines crossing their backs.  Red spots appear on the fringe surrounding the head and two orange-red spots mark the top of the elytra (wing covering).  As they mature, more green coloration becomes apparent and they grow bigger with more angular elytra.  By the time they are mature adults, they are completely green and their elytra is shaped almost like a shield with a triangular center. \n\nGreen Stink Bugs emit a foul odor when they feel threatened  and are usually left alone because it smells quite acrid.

They tend to mind their own business and can be found sipping on flower nectar during the summer, but in the early spring, females prepare to lay eggs.\n\nFemales will dig into loose soil and create many deep tunnels.  When established, she then covers them to hide their existence.  A female will track a small insect and sting them to paralyze them, but not to kill them.  Once the prey is immobile, she will clutch it antennae and her mandible (mouth parts) in order to fly it back to the tunnels.  While in flight with her prey, it is not uncommon to see birds like robins or tanagers attempt to steal her meal from her by chasing her until she drops it. No other known species of Digger Wasp is known to be harassed by birds in this way.  If the female is successful in returning to her tunnels with her catch, she will place the paralyzed prey aside to quickly inspect a tunnel.  If it looks like it's still intact, she will pull the paralyzed insect, head first, down into it. She then lays an egg on the insect, exits the tunnel and covers it over again.  She repeats this process for each tunnel. Unlike other wasps, she does not actively defend her nest.\n\nOnce hatched, the wasp larvae will feed on the living, yet immobile, insect until they are developed enough to leave the tunnel lair in the summer.  Eventually, the parasitism of the paralyzed insect kills it.\n\nScientists are studying the behavior of this unique species.  Great Golden Digger Wasps seem to display a type of internal programming.  If their insect prey is moved away from the tunnel while the female inspects it, she will emerge, relocate it, bring it back to the tunnel entrance and start the inspection all over again. Every female showed the same 'start inspection again' behavior when tested in that way.\n\nFemales have also shown that they do not keep a tally of how many insects they catch versus how many tunnels they created. If some are stolen by birds, they do not realize that they are short on insects compared to tunnels.\n\nWith such gorgeous coloration, mild demeanor and interesting behaviors, the Great Golden Digger Wasp is one to watch, not destroy. Perhaps a careful observer will discover even more fascinating things about this species.","sizerange":[15,23],"colors":["black","orange"],"keywords":["flying"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","British Columbia","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan","Mexico"],"category":"Bee, Ant, Wasp and Similar","common_name":"Great Golden Digger Wasp","scientific_name":"Sphex ichneumoneus"},{"name":"Great Blue Skimmer","about":"The brightly colored bodies of the Great Blue Skimmer are characteristic of most of the dragonflies in the Libellulidae family.

This makes them somewhat of an aborist's ally in maintaining tree health.  They can become a nuisance, however, if they catch the scent of spoiling vegetation in the garden.  This species of beetle will take advantage of lazy or overwhelmed gardeners.  If fruits and vegetables are left on the vine to rot, or fall victim to a disease and begin to spoil, they release volatile chemicals into the air and the Four-Spot Sap Beetle will descend on the dying fruit/vegetable to feed on the residues.

Removing diseased, spoiled and rotting produce at regular intervals effectively prevents the beetle from finding a garden. \n\nAdult females will lay eggs on decaying plant matter after they emerge from overwintering. The eggs hatch sometime in June or July and the larvae feed on whatever plant material is near them until they pupate.  Once they become adults, they seek out food sources.

The debris depends on what is on hand when they are forming the cocoon.  \n\nThe caterpillar will spend much of its life in this bag, hanging from a branch.  It is when they crawl around for food that people begin to notice them.

Once some ground is covered, they then drag their back ends to catch up.  The result is what looks like strange genetics experiment: half worm, half plant. \n\nOnce the caterpillar's life stage is over though, it will pupate in the bag it created and emerge a dark and furry moth with feathery antennae.  Wingless adult females will keep their bags.  Males will fly to females to mate and females lay their fertilized eggs in their old bags.

It is a type of Praying Mantis. They are highly recognizable creatures, mainly thanks their odd shape. Their bodies are relatively large and long with four legs at the abdomen area and two larger legs that appear more like arms.  These appendages, called forelegs, are bent at severe angles giving them the appearance of holding their 'hands' in prayer. \n\nThe European species comes in a variety of colors ranging from bright green to dark brown.  Like all mantises, or mantids, the female is larger than the male, especially at the abdomen where eggs are made.  They are hefty insects and females are unlikely to fly as their light wings are not able to hold their weight very well.  Females use their wings to scare off would-be predators by flaring them open while raising their 'arms'.  The pose startles some predators, sparing the mantis. Males can and do fly.  After mating, females have been known to eat the male they reproduced with. \n\nEuropean Mantises prefer a diet of insects and operate during the day. They make great \"garden enforcers\" because of their insect diet. For this very reason they were introduced into America by early  gardeners.  European Mantises have voracious appetites and can keep pest insect populations under control, limiting the damage they do to plants and flowers.\n\nObserving a Praying Mantis is a special thing, but leave it in its natural habitat where it can hunt all day long.  Trying to capture and keep mantises as 'pets' only results in cruelly starving them to death.  Unlike humans that eat 'three square meals' a day, mantises eat non-stop all day long.

They also do not bite or pinch people on the ear.  In fact, bug literature about earwigs states that they are harmless to people. It is believed that the name for this insect was intended to be \"earwing\" because of the shape of the wing, but somehow the 'n' was dropped and a mythology about the insect was created.\n\nTestimonies of those who have been bitten or pinched exist, but their pincers are not intended for use against humans. Their pincers designed for use in defense against other earwigs (males fighting for females) as well as against predators in self-defense.  The pincers also help the earwig fold its wings to close them.\n\nThey do have wings, but rarely fly. Adults of this species tend hide under objects by day, and sometimes in clusters.  Lifting rocks, logs and BBQ grill covers may reveal a group of them.  They can crawl into small spaces like outdoor garage door openers and outlets, startling the unsuspecting human that opens the lids.  \n\nThey are considered somewhat beneficial in gardens because they eat aphids.  However, if insect prey is scarce, they may eat the roots of planted flowers (in containers as well as in ground).  They will also nibble on the flower blossoms of fruits and vegetables, making the produce inedible.  In such a case, they become pests.  Their population numbers swelled so rapidly in Portland, Oregon back in 1924 that the city declared a state of emergency.  The European Earwig was decimating its crop and fruit tree harvest and measures were taken to eradicate them from the area.

As recently as June 2002, the beetle was identified in Windsor, Ontario, Canada and in the Southeast portion of the state of Michigan, USA. It is native to Asia, found locally in parts of Japan, the Koreas, China and Mongolia and Russia. A few likely hitched a ride on cargo during shipping and that is when trouble on the North American continent began.  \n\nThe Emerald Ash Borer is a highly invasive species, capable of populating a large area in a very short period of time.  It is also highly recognizable thanks to its metallic green coloring. The insect makes no distinction between natural, wild growth and landscaped growth, attacking the leaves and bark of the Ash tree species wherever it happens to grow.\n\nEmerald Ash Borers (EABs) are related to native species of North American tree borers. In that respect, they share some similarities in how they feed, mate and otherwise operate in adulthood. Adults appear in the late Spring months and into early August, as one generation  lives per year. The adults that emerge leave a small yet tell-tale \"D\" shaped hole in the bark of the Ash tree they inhabit and proceed to feed off of the tree's foliage before mating several weeks later. \n\nUpon mating, the female beetle can lay upwards of 50 to 100 eggs on the surface of the tree, allowing the larvae to easily begin boring into the tree once they are born. Larvae dig into the area just under the bark and continue boring tunnels while feeding on the sapwood inside the tree.  This draining of tree fluids continues from the summer season into the fall. The death of the tree begins due to starvation.  The small tunnels block or destroy the xylem in the tree trunk which allows water to move up the tree.  Ash trees that are infected and already dying will have seasons where only a few branch cluster grow leaves, while other parts of the tree have none (like in winter).  Suffering Ash trees will try to grow new shoots from the base of their trunks in an effort to stay alive.  \n\nAsh trees represent a tremendous amount to the natural beauty, ecosystem and economy to areas. The larvae are instrumental in the internal destruction of the tree itself and the only known resolution to the insect's expansion is the complete removal of all infected trees. This usually results in an entire neighborhood's treescape changing because Ash trees were popular decades ago in urban and suburban planning. Only this species was planted for blocks and now, if infected, blocks lose their shade and character.\n\nResearch and a quarantine of infected areas and trees is currently ongoing throughout many states and provinces. It is said that the presence of Woodpeckers might be an indication of infestation because Woodpeckers seem enjoy hunting the larvae under the bark. At this time, the EAB feeds only on Ash trees (known as Fraxinus spp.).

Hatched larvae bore their way into the center of the stems to feed on the plant's juices. They leave behind frass (insect excrement) that resembles wood shavings. As they mature, the larvae continue to bore down to the roots of the plant where they will pupate.

It is a good worker in the garden and helps control real pests from destroying plants.\n\nLike most members of the Orbweaver family, the Cross Spider sits in the center of its web with its head down.  It may be spotted at times on the edge of its web or on a stem with its legs tucked under itself.  If it feels threatened or in danger, it may first use its legs to violently shake and shimmy its web to startle the threat in hopes of causing it to leave.  If that does not happen, the spider will drop to the ground and return to its web's center when it feels safe again.  This spider creates a new web every day.\n\nThe Cross Spider female is almost twice the size of the male.  There is evidence that some females eat the male after mating.  Females lay eggs in a sac that is usually hung from the web.  Their life span is only 12 months long.\n\nThis spider can be found in a variety of habitats.

Coffinflies are further set apart from mayflies by their dark-colored, patterned  wings. Like dragonflies, coffinflies are resident to slow-moving or still water sources like ponds, creeks, small rivers and shallow lakes. \n\nCoffinflies originally got their name because some species were found in exhumed coffins.  Their larvae burrowed deep in the ground to the body inside the coffin and aided decomposition. This particular species prefers a water environment, not earth, in its larval stage, and adults can be found in the hundreds of thousands from the spring to summer if the water source is clean and unpolluted. \n\nThe larvae  look like small versions of lobsters, or crayfish, and they live that younger phase of their lives completely under water.  They burrow into the sediment or sand at the bottom of the pond or lake and feed on algae and plant matter.  Because they are still developing while living in water, larvae can be indicators of a water system's cleanliness. Even moderate levels of pollution have been known to obliterate a population  of larvae in a dirty body of water. \n\nThe Coffinfly undergoes a series of molts (phase changes) as it matures to its adult form.  One intermediate phase, called the subimago, includes the formation of wings and tiny hairs that start to prevent them from submerging under water. Anglers (fishermen and women) call this phase a \"dun\" and may use larvae, or plastic replications of them, as bait to catch certain species of fish that naturally feed on them.  After another molt, they become more mature adults called imago, which are known as \"spinners\" to anglers.  \n\nAdults are land-bound and do not feed.

They have voracious appetites for garden insects and are extremely beneficial to have around.  Females need a lot of energy to make eggs and will eat any insect they can catch.  This often means beetles and aphids that usually destroy flowers are removed from the area, sparing the plants.  The Chinese Mantis is so welcome in gardens that their eggs are often purchased in garden stores and online so that they are ready to hunt when summer rolls around. \n\nFemales are larger than males.  They have been known to eat the male after reproducing.  Eggs are laid along the bottom of twigs and branches.  They look like flat disks, or pumpkin seeds (pepitas). \n\nWhile any Praying Mantis is a treat to observe, it is best to leave it in its natural habitat where it can hunt all day long.

They are fond of tunneling through dead or decaying wood to build colonies.  This has led to infestations in homes, offices and other buildings. Though they begin building by boring through weak wood, they can also chew through healthy, living trees if the colony needs the space. A colony has one queen, many workers and some scouts. In order to prevent re-infestation of buildings, the egg-laying queen needs to be killed. Professional exterminators are usually necessary to eliminate large infestations in human habitats. \n\nTheir huge jaws are adept at shaving timber, eating other insects and drinking plant juices.  Though they are not poisonous, the bite of a Carpenter Ant can hurt thanks to the large mouth parts. Carpenter Ants are also able to spray formic acid from the tip of the abdomen, which may irritate skin and eyes.  Carpenter Ants do not have stingers.\n\nThe diet of this ant is varied. It eats other insects, plant juices and the 'honeydew' secreted from the bottoms of aphids. (Most ants 'shepherd' aphids in order to collect this sweet liquid.) Carpenter Ants do not eat wood, they just live in it.\n\nIn hot summer months, Carpenter Ants are more active at night.  An old, established colony will eventually produce long-winged males and queens called alates.  The winged ants fly out of the colony to mate, creating new or satellite colonies. Swarms of alates are usually seen in the spring.

The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug uses its proboscis to poke a hole through the skin of a piece of fruit (still growing on the tree) and it sucks out the fruit's juices.

They have bright blue eyes and a matching blue on their thorax and at the tip of their tail.  Females may have more brown on their head and eyes, but still retain some shade of blue on their heads.  The Blue-fronted Damselfly is a member of the Narrow-winged Damselflies.  Their wings are very thin where they meet the body.  When resting, they fold their wings above their body.\n\nFemales lay their eggs on floating objects in water.  The majority of the life cycle is spent in the water as a naiad, breathing the dissolved oxygen from the water through gills found at the tip of their abdomen (tail).  Once they mature, they will shed their juvenile 'skin' and emerge as flying adults.\n\nNaiads are terrific aquatic predators with huge appetites, eating insects, worms and even small fish.  Their extendable lower lip allows them a long reach.  Quick expansion and a set of teeth secure their prey. Because of its appetite for insects, Blue-fronted Damselflies are beneficial to a riparian ecosystem, keeping populations of smaller insects in balance.","sizerange":[33,40],"colors":["blue","black","brown","gray","red"],"keywords":["bright blue","flying","helpful","skinny"],"reach":["Maine","New Hampshire","Vermont","New York","New Jersey","Maryland","Massachusetts","Rhode Island","Connecticut","Delaware","Pennsylvania","West Virginia","Virginia","North Carolina","South Carolina","Georgia","Kentucky","Tennessee","Ohio","Michigan","Minnesota","Wisconsin","North Dakota","South Dakota","Indiana","Illinois","Iowa","Missouri","Arkansas","Mississippi","Louisiana","Alabama","Texas","Oklahoma","Kansas","Nebraska"],"category":"Dragonfly or Damselfly","common_name":"Blue-fronted Dancer","scientific_name":"Argia apicalis"},{"name":"Black-Tailed Bee Fly","about":"The Black-Tailed Bee Fly is a fuzzy, hovering, buzzing look-a-like to a bumble bee.  The long proboscis ('tongue'), however quickly gives away its true identity.  Bee Flies also have long, thin legs that lack pollen baskets and fuzzy legs typically found on the hind legs of honeybees and bumble bees, respectively. Adults drink flower nectar and are fond of lilac and plum flowers.  Larvae have a more nefarious diet.\n\nFemale Black-Tailed Bee Flies lay their fertilized eggs in the ground nests of certain solitary bee species.  The Black-Tailed Bee Fly larvae hatch and eat the larvae of the resident bees, making them parasites. Once they eat the competition, they go on to eat any food stores left by their mother. They will then pupate in that nest and eventually emerge as adults in the summer.\n\nThis species is most active in the summer on sunny days.  They can be found in open fields, back yards and park, either resting on plants or buzzing over blossoms.  They are able to hover over the flowers they drink from, much like a hummingbird.  Males will often hover over flowers while waiting for a female to pass by.  Males then dart after the female in the hope of mating with her.  While observers can get close, the Black-Tailed Bee Fly is quite aware of its surroundings and can bolt away so quickly, they are difficult to catch.","sizerange":[12,16],"colors":["yellow","black","white","brown"],"keywords":["fuzzy","bumble","hairy","flying","tongue","legs","hover"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","British Columbia","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan","Mexico"],"category":"Fly or Mosquito","common_name":"Black-Tailed Bee Fly","scientific_name":"Bombylius major"},{"name":"Blue Dasher","about":"Blue Dashers are one of the most abundant dragonflies in the U.S. and can be found near slow moving water sources, marshes and ponds.

This arachnid picks up the Lyme disease-causing bacteria from feeding on mice and deer.\n\nCommonly found in the Eastern United States, the Black-Legged Tick adult sits on low plant vegetation (shrubs, ferns, flowers) until a potential host animal walks by.  With its front legs outstretched, it clings onto whatever it can: fur, tail, clothing, etc. It then crawls to to warmer parts of the body because blood is closer to the surface in those areas.  It will bite the victim without pain as its saliva has an anesthetic chemical in it that numbs the bite site.  It will drawn a blood meal from the host until it is engorged with blood and the abdomen will expand in size, turning redder in color.  Ticks may feed on a host for days. Their barbed feeding tube helps keep them latched on more securely.  \n\nIt is during feeding that the Lyme Disease causing bacteria can pass from the tick into the host (deer, human, mouse, etc.). The longer the tick has to feed, the greater the opportunity for the bacteria to move and infect. Because of this, The Center for Disease Control in the U.S. suggests people who finds ticks on themselves are encouraged to remove them as soon as possible.  Because the infecting vector may be in the feeding tube, even if the tick is crushed or decapitated, it may still transmit the bacteria.  Complete removal of the tick within 24 hours of the initial bite can reduce possible infection according to the CDC. If you have been bitten by a Black-Legged Tick, seek medical attention and get tested for Lyme Disease. Early treatment for Lyme Disease aids in better managing its symptoms.\n\nAll Ticks are arachnids, not insects.  They have eight legs so counting legs of a creature crawling on you can aid in identifying them quickly. Males appear as a dark brown or even black coloring while females feature orange coloring.

Males, however, lack such a weapon and are not really known to bite.  Even immature females do not have the power to poison a human yet.  They tend to spin their webs in places that may be disturbed or visited by humans, thus increasing the likelihood of an unpleasant encounter between the two.\n\nFemales have the trademark red 'hourglass' on the bottom of the round abdomen (\"belly\"). Males change in color and pattern as they mature, but are always smaller in size (about half the size) compared to the female.  Females are known to eat the male after mating, earning them the name 'widow'.  Females can store the sperm from a mating and use it to produce subsequent batches of eggs, long after the male is dead. Lifespans for females range from one to three years; males may live about two months.\n\nThe bodies of both genders are shiny and hairless. Juveniles can start out brown, white and orange, growing more black as they age.\n\nWebs are irregular in shape, but strong, and are built under stones, near openings of rodent holes and on outbuildings such as sheds, outhouses or barns.  They are unlikely to leave their webs and do not go out of their way to bite humans. Females guarding eggs will be more inclined to attack and bite instead of attempt to escape from a perceived threat.\n\nThe venom in adult females is highly poisonous to humans and REQUIRES MEDICAL ATTENTION. Some people feel the bite (like a pin-prick), others do not.  Pain will eventually begin at the site of the bite and then it spreads to the stomach and back with cramping in the first 8-12 hours of the bite. Other symptoms also may include: sweating, nausea,  tremors, restlessness, fever and headache.\n\nIf you suspect you have been bitten by a Black Widow, try to capture and/or kill the spider for proper identification at a doctor's office. If you cannot, don't fret. Do not attempt to suck out the venom.  Immediately wash the bite area with soap and water.  Put ice the bite site and elevate that body part. The Mayo Clinic recommends tying a tourniquet above the bite if on an appendage to help slow the spread of the venom. Seek medical attention immediately.  Though it is rare for humans to die from a Black Widow bite because victims eventually get medical help, early treatment can reduce pain and illness and quicken healing. This may include taking antivenin and other medications. Those with heart conditions may even need hospitalization.  Every human body is different. It is essential to let a medical professional treat this kind of bite.","sizerange":[3,10],"colors":["white","red","black","orange","brown","yellow","white"],"keywords":["shiny","pattern","hourglass","widow","biting","venomous","harmful"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Mexico"],"category":"Spider","common_name":"Black Widow","scientific_name":"Latrodectus mactans","other_names":"Black Widow"},{"name":"Black Vine Weevil","about":"The Black Vine Weevil is a known pest to an expansive variety of plants and usually feeds at night.

Their antennae bend just after coming out of the head.\n\nTheir name suggests that it is an ant that builds, and it does that very well.  The actual places ant nests are built in can be quite a nuisance for humans.  Carpenter ants are unlike termites as they do not eat wood. They prefer to live inside wood, not consume it. \n\nThey build colonies of up to 10,000 ants in dead trees, telephone poles, wood piles and sheds, under house insulation or inside the walls of houses. Infestations can cause a lot of damage and are best removed by a professional exterminator.  \n\nBlack Carpenter Ants do bite, though they cannot sting. Another defensive maneuver they use is spraying formic acid at a possible threat. All members of the family Formicidae build up an internal store of formic acid and use it to ward off predators.\n\nBlack Carpenter Ants feed on plant juices, fungus, food scraps, and even other insects. Most food foraging is done under cover of night. \n\nWorker ants cannot fly and live to solely to serve the one queen in a mature colony. Solitary scouts are sent to forage for food and return to the spot with more ants later. Males have wings and do fly as do potential queens.  From late spring to the middle of summer, they form swarms as they are actively trying to breed. The queen ant produces eggs quickly and it takes little time for a small colony to grow into a massive one.  A large colony will start expanding to smaller satellite colonies is space is limited.","sizerange":[6,13],"colors":["black","brown","yellow","gray"],"keywords":["hairy","biting","jaws","sprays","acid","formic","harmful","stingless","flying"],"reach":["Alabama","Arizona","Arkansas","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan","Mexico"],"category":"Bee, Ant, Wasp and Similar","common_name":"Black Carpenter Ant","scientific_name":"Camponotus pennsylvanicus","other_names":"Black Ant, Carpenter Ant"},{"name":"Black and Yellow Mud Dauber","about":"The alarming yellow and black coloration on the Black and Yellow Mud Dauber causes many observers to slowly back away.

Pestering with and trying to handle any kind of wasp is not recommended, but this less aggressive species doesn't seem to mind a curious admirer.\n\nThe name 'Black and Yellow Mud Dauber' comes from this species' coloration as well as its handmade creation.  A dauber is a term used for an inartistic painter.  In the autumn, a female Mud Dauber forms mud into balls that are then hollowed out.  These balls form cells for her eggs.  The mud balls are glued together with more mud to create a crude nest.  Nests are usually placed under bridges or rocks, or along exposed beams of abandoned buildings or barns.  These mud nests have also been found in garages, attics and outdoor picnic shelters in parks. The mud nest is kept dry by the structure's roof or overhang.  Females lay an egg in a cell and place several paralyzed spiders she caught in the cell with the egg. Once an egg hatches, the wasp larva feeds on the the immobile spiders in its cell.  After growing in size, the larva will form a paper-like cocoon and overwinter in the cell.

They are also distinct as some have a zig-zag type strand pattern called the stabilimentum running down the middle of their webs. Additionally, their webs are built as a spiral that builds out from the center; a classic feature of all Orbweaver spiders. These spiders sit on the web up-side-down with their heads closer to the ground.  Their long, lean legs make them appear substantially large and intimidating to humans.  If disturbed or threatened, this spider may immediately drop to the ground.  It may also begin bouncing on its web in an effort to confuse a predator by making it difficult to get a clear target.

They do not transmit diseases to people, but they can create areas of great skin irritation and itching from their bites caused by a reaction to the Bed Bug's saliva.\n\nThe Bed Bug's body is very flat and rusty red colored; sometimes it looks purple or even brown.  It is more reddish in color just after a blood feeding. They are only 4mm to 6mm in length and can be difficult to spot on dark bedding or mattresses. Antennae are present and appear quite thin and segmented. Short stubby legs complement the short - almost unseen - stubby, useless wings. \n\nBed Bugs enjoy the warmth and constant food supply that a mammal host offers. During the day, they hide in crevices.  At night they come out of hiding to feed.  They suck the blood out from their host to mature into adulthood. The bites themselves are not painful so the host remains sleeping through the night.  A Bed Bug will bite its human host, drink some blood and then move a little and bite a new place. This repetitive behavior results in huge areas of afflicted skin.  Bed Bugs can survive without food for 12 to 15 months. They will travel a great distance for a meal.\n\nTo reproduce, males inject sperm directly inside the female's abdomen where eggs are fertilized.  A female can lay up to 300 eggs in her lifetime.  These eggs are very small and white, but are still visible on a mattress for those carefully looking for them. Many generations of Bed Bugs can be born in a year which means they can reproduce quite rapidly in an area a spread to surrounding areas, quickly infesting other mattresses. \n\nBed Bugs do not just stay on mattresses in bedrooms. They can hide in furniture crevices and clothing as well.  Because of this, people can transfer Bed Bugs to various locations, which is why hotel rooms can be plagued with them. Immaculate housekeeping cannot prevent infestation.\n\nTo check for Bed Bugs, uncover the mattress by removing the sheets and any mattress cover.  Visually scan all edges and seams for the brown bugs, their tiny white eggs, small spots of blood (from previous victims) and/or brown spots of fecal matter left by the bugs. If you strongly suspect Bud Bugs presence, check the box spring beneath the mattress as well. If staying in a hotel or vacation rental, do this mattress check BEFORE unpacking.  This limits exposure to your belongings should you find evidence of Bed Bugs and need to leave the room permanently.\n\nIf you have been bitten by Bed Bugs, seeking medical attention can help treat the symptoms (swelling, redness, intense itching) and make your recovery more comfortable. On the bright side (if it helps) at least the bugs do not transfer diseases that will make you sick.\n\nA professional exterminator needs to be contacted to remove infestations.","sizerange":[4,6],"colors":["red","brown","purple"],"keywords":["small","eggs","harmful","biting"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","British Columbia","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan","Mexico"],"category":"True Bug","common_name":"Bed Bug","scientific_name":"Cimex lectularius"},{"name":"Basilica Orb Weaver","about":"The colors, pattern and shape of the abdomen make this spider a real stand out.

The weaving inside the dome is small and mesh-like as opposed to open and circular like the surrounding web.  Dangling threads from the dome aid in creating a sticky trap. Egg sacs can also be seen hanging from a female's web. The egg sacs are white and bead-shaped, like a strand of pearls.\n\nThey are most active from late spring to early summer.

Hence, it is beginning to replace the native North American species of lady beetles across the continent.  \n\nIn addition to the loss of native strongholds, this species overwinters in clusters, usually in warm buildings (homes, offices), where a few can make their way in from the exterior walls into the building's interior.

They then digest these plant juices and excrete a sticky, sugary 'honeydew' which may attract other garden insects like ants.  \n\nSmall populations are generally not a major problem for gardeners,however, they are really fast at reproducing and large populations can take over a crop if not controlled. Many gardeners buy containers of live lady beetles (ladybugs) to spread over their garden in an attempt to curb population growth of aphids.  Recognizing and allowing fire beetles and parasitic wasps to visit the infested plants can also aid in reducing aphid numbers and damage.  Chemical pesticides that specifically kill aphids also exist, but will likely require multiple applications.

They crawl to warm parts of the body (armpits and inner thighs on humans) and bite into the flesh using a numbing agent in the saliva that renders the puncture unnoticeable.  They then proceed to suck the blood from the host until engorged and more than double its original size.  \n\nTicks are notorious for carrying the bacterium that causes Lyme Disease in humans. Not all ticks are infected with them and not all bites of infected ticks result in Lyme Disease, but medical professionals recommend always seeing a doctor if you suspect, or confirm, a tick bite.","sizerange":[2,5],"colors":["ivory","brown","red","black"],"keywords":["tick","blood","round","slow"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Alberta","British Columbia","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan","Mexico"],"category":"Mite or Tick","common_name":"American Dog Tick","scientific_name":"Argas spp.","other_names":"Wood Tick"},{"name":"American Cockroach","about":"The American Cockroach is actually not native to the United States. Instead it originates from Africa.  It was transplanted to and established in North America after hundreds of years of trans-oceanic shipping. The cockroaches would stow away with cargo and passengers and were introduced to the continent as well as Antarctica and Greenland. \n\nTheir original habitat was warm and humid, but they have adapted to colder climates by remaining in warmer places such as buildings, warehouses and homes.  They have also been able to reside in colder, but sheltered areas such as underground subways and sewers.\n\nThe American Cockroach appears glossy and carries a reddish-brown look throughout its body. Even the wings are the same color and darker brown marks can be seen at the center of the pronotum ('shoulders'). The female has a shorter pair of wings wings while the male's wings extend past his abdomen. This makes them appear longer. They are very good flyers, though most humans see them running on floors, walls and ceilings more often than flying.\n\nAdults eat moist foods.  This can be human food, pet food or other edible organic matter. Because they eat the same foods as humans and pets, they are considered a huge commercial and personal pest. \n\nFemales lay  about a dozen eggs at a time and then carry them on their backs for a few days, unloading them in a dark area where the eggs can hatch undisturbed. Nymphs (juveniles) look like smaller versions of adults and can take up to a year to grow to full size. Female life spans are at least a year long.\n\nMost cockroaches flee for cover when suddenly illuminated, however, they will crawl and explore areas and rooms  with lights on. \n\nCockroach infestations are a common problem in homes, apartments and food warehouses.  Professional exterminators are very helpful in eradicating them from the premises.","sizerange":[27,40],"colors":["brown","red","yellow"],"keywords":["fat","wide","fast","flying"],"reach":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Mexico","Alberta","British Columbia","Manitoba","New Brunswick","Newfoundland and Labrador","Nova Scotia","Ontario","Prince Edward Island","Quebec","Saskatchewan"],"category":"Cockroach","common_name":"American Cockroach","scientific_name":"Periplaneta americana","other_names":"Cockroach, Waterbug, Roach, Palmetto Bug"}]}
