# Connecticut Insect Identifier

Simple web app to identify common insects found in Connecticut.

Built on a Saturday using React, Browserify, Babel, Gulp, Bootstrap, Sass. Also
has a scraper component (using the Osmosis scraping library) that gets data from [insectidentification.org](http://www.insectidentification.org).

Deployed using Github Pages. Check out the gh-pages branch for compiled code.

I made this for my final project in PSLC 1125 (Insects, Food and Culture) at UConn.
